# Documentation Hub

This folder contains the canonical project documentation. Some older/unused files were removed during the migration — this hub points to the active locations.

Active docs

- Getting Started
  - [Setup Guide](getting-started/setup.md)
- Process & Collaboration
  - [Branching Workflow](../docs/branching.md)
  - [Collaboration Notes](../docs/collaboration.md)
- Project Management
  - [Sprint 1 PRD](project-management/sprint1/sprint1-prd.md)
  - [Sprint 2 PRD](project-management/sprint2/Sprint2PRD.md)

If you relied on a doc that got removed, please open an issue or re-add a trimmed version under `docs/` — we intentionally removed an older set of cluttering files during the migration.
